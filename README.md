Tool for removing purple fringes (axial chromatic aberration) 
from digital photos.

So far this is a prototype implemented in OCaml. It is very slow but
produces decent results. The next step will be to create a Gimp script
that implements the same transformation.

For examples, click on individual `.jpg` and `-fixed.jpg` files, or
`git clone git://github.com/mjambon/purple-fringe.git` and open
`examples.html` in a browser.
